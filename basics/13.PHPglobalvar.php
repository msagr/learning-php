    /* 

        There are several predefined variables in PHP called "superglobals", which means they are always
        accessible, regardless of scope.

        The PHP superglobal variables are :-

            1.  $GLOBALS
            2.  $_SERVER
            3.  $_REQUEST
            4.  $_POST
            5.  $_GET
            6.  $_FILES
            7.  $_ENV
